Music Scores

this is my attempt to store musescore scores and try to put some "versioning" over it.

these scores are/should be uncompressed (git cannot handle diffs very well when they are binary)
for that purpose ive created a .gitignore file which only allows uncompressed file-suffixes.

feel free to check this out. ;)

you also might find some scores at: https://musescore.com/user/33748214
